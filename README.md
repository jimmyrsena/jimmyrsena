  - 💬 I am 46 years old and currently living in Brazil. I have experience with JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and now, I am learning Python and Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. I have also learned computer forensic analysis, which has helped me develop important skills such as creativity, communication, marketing, analytical capability, and computational management.
